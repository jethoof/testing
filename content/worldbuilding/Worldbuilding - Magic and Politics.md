Either to improve or control there will be regulation and politics around magic here are some questions I ask myself about politics being influenced by magic.

# Questions
- Is use of magic regulated?
	- How do they differ from one faction to another?
		- What kind of friction are there between factions due to regulation?
- Are magic users are in high positions in politics due to their advantage?
	- or the opposite due to regulations?
- What aspect of magic is prohibited or promoted?
