Prompt #2: Write a scene where one character lies to another. Why do they do it? Does the other character know they’re lying? How do they react?
___
Ben pretended he wasn't intimidated by the old man in front with a hook on his right hand. The man reeked with alcohol and urine, considering the general atmosphere of the lower deck this should have been an acceptable condition for the most of the people on board. Ben was an exception. 
He quickly came to realize why not many hawkers traveled far up north. The ship, Winking Sparrow, was full of people like the man in front of him, rough, unclean and uneducated.
"You heard me sonny or what, you deaf?" the old man repeated with his spit flying everywhere. Ben swore some just hit his face.
"Oh apologies, I was just admiring the scene." Ben quickly lifted his gaze from the hook and awkwardly smiled back at him. I'd better leave this place and head up to see Marney instead, at this rate, they'll eat her for dinner. he thought. 
"apologies accepted and what scene, you mean these? I could tell you all about it. It happened when..." the old man started rambling on with heavy sea accent it almost sounded like another language to him and he couldn't simply get up and leave or else he feared he might get hooked by the old man's left... hand.
Ben bitterly smiled and nodded in parts where the old man was explaining about the fishing trip to the deep seas and where his ship was surrounded by a thick fog then people started loosing their marbles and started attacking each other thinking they're the monsters. He claimed he kept his head above his shoulders.
