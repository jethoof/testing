Can you envision the moment in your protagonist’s life when his misbelief took root? Perhaps you have a vague idea, and that’s fine. Take a minute and sketch it out the way Jennie did in a simple paragraph. If you’re writing a mystery, courtroom drama, or police procedural, your focus might be as much on the crime as on the investigator, if not more so, thus you might do this for the bad guy and for your sleuth, whether she is a detective, lawyer, investigator, spy, or curious next-door neighbor. Remember: every character filters the world through his or her own internal logic, based on what the events in their past forced them to face. The goal is to find the defining moment in their past.
