In D&D 5E there is a table called Trinkets with 100 different trinkets and I started to use that table to generate small little magical items with the following format like they do for Diablo games:

Prefix + Trinket + Suffix

Some of the trinkets on the table do have some descriptors to it so you can take liberty in modifying them as you please. It's almost like a writing prompt and then I imbue magical properties and still thinking about what else I could add in more but here's one:

Prefix: Tricolored (3 charges a day)
Trinket: A mosaic tile with a multicolored, glazed surface
Suffix: Tensor's Floating Disc (1st level spell)

Description: This multicolored mosaic tile is round has three panels and about the size that fits within your palm.

Function: Once attuned, you can use a command word as action and cast Tensor's Floating Disc three times a day. Once used, the color of the tile fades to dull gray and it will recharge on the next sunrise. If you use up all the charges, it will turn into a mundane charge until recharged. 

I don't  have a solid structure for this yet but I am starting to explore some sort of rule to create more of these wonderous items. I might just generate a table of its own for you to play with
