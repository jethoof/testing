I never had the chance to do an extensive work on the world but worked on it whenever I wanted to run away from the real world and get myself lost in my fantasy world.  That fantasy world opened up to a whole new vista when I shared the world with other people to play table top roleplaying games. \n\n2020 presented an interesting proposal I could not refuse, I was stuck at home like many of us and I had too much time to ask myself the questions I haven't been asking myself for years; How is my world doing? I also had an opportunity to run a lot of Dungeons and Dragons online with many groups and was able to reconstruct my world again and since I have more time I started to wonder whether I can write a short story about it.... But where do I start?\n\nWhat initially started as my new knowledge management system (KMS) ended up being used as my personal knowledge base for D\u0026D and all the lore I have created. [Obsidian](http:www.obsidian.md) is the said system and I fell in love with and the discord community. There I learned about [NaNoWriMo](http:www.nanowrimo.org) with their annual writing challenges and I decided to join the community to write something with a solid beginning and and end. \n\nThis website came to be to share some of my writings with my community, learn bit more about coding in my spare time and sharing some of my writing journey here.\n\n### First day of April FOOLS, I mean NaNoWriMO actually. \nI joined the [Virtual Write-in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utW1-FHDTOE\u0026t=5s\u0026ab_channel=NaNoWriMo), thank you Katherine for the wonderful facilitation, to learn more about what is going on during the writing camp. It was a bit daunting at first but nonetheless exciting to participate in my first group writing sessions without feeling like this is some sort of essay I have to turn for an English exam. English is my second language and writing is my nemesis for my entire academic life, and still is today. Curse you articles why thou art exist? But the facilitation was smooth and the topics were refreshing for me to think about what I'm going to write - not entirely - to think from my potential character's perspective with writing prompts. I clocked in 800+ words in on the story I wanted to develop on. Plus the side writing I did that was not part of the project scope it slowly rolled towards 2000 words today in total. I never tracked how many words I write a day on a daily basis other than just writing it for fun for my D\u0026D so this was rather exciting to track it for once. As for my activity you can check out how I am doing [from here.](nanowrimo/202204/Introduction.md)\n\n### Reading List\nI am going rather slow since I am trying to read other books in the meantime to learn how to write and edit it going forward and the current books I'm reading are:\n1.

There are numerous times when I was setting up simple recorded messages on my voicemail greeting where I pretended to pick up the phone, greet and listen to what the person was saying only to abruptly let them know that this is actually a recorded message. I had so many voice recordings where it picked up people in the mid sentence or worse when they realized that they've been talking to themselves for a good 20 seconds.

Ben swore some just hit his face.\n\"Oh apologies, I was just admiring the scene.\" Ben quickly lifted his gaze from the hook and awkwardly smiled back at him.

Ben was healthy and he had all the love and attention from his grandfather. Ollie was going to be the heir for the merchant business of the family and to make up for his lack of health he made up with his brilliant intellect and there was no dispute about how much smarter he was compared to Ben. He was analytical and thoughtful. it was admiring how calm and collected he was all the time despite he's just 2 years older than himself. \n\nThere was a time when their father was taking his sons to the market to teach them the art of barter and appraisal of goods. Ben accompanied his father and his brother as if he was an appendix because his father's gaze was always on Ollie rather than at Ben, teaching him the basics of reading the scales and talking to fellow merchants. Ollie was spared from doing small errands as his frail body won't last if he was running around the market area so it always fell on Ben's laps. \n\nOne time he was watching deal of some precious metal trade and the man was passing around the object to inspect them. their father was reminded the two boys to pay close attention. they were weighing the ingot on the scale and the father was holding it to inspect it and requested the merchant whether his boys can have a look at the ingot themselves.\n\nthe father gave the boys his own ingot  about the same size and explained about using your own reference to do the deal. so both of them were able to hold the ingots on each hand to compare. When Ben held them, there was this weird tingling sensation on his fingertips that he couldn't express with his words. Something about the two ingots were different. It was about the same size and same weight. both had passed the scratch test to see if it was simply coated or the real deal. But something was off in Ben's hands as if something was not natural about it. Ben said they're different and the merchant's ingot felt unnatural.\n\nThe merchant laughed off and wanted to rush to close the transactions.","lastmodified":"2022-04-03T00:21:49.818247764Z","tags":null},"/notes/Legends":{"title":"Legends","content":"This is soon to be my growing list of [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) data for who knows why I am setting this up for other than I could potentially use it for sorting things out.
