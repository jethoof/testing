There are numerous times when I was setting up simple recorded messages on my voicemail greeting where I pretended to pick up the phone, greet and listen to what the person was saying only to abruptly let them know that this is actually a recorded message. I had so many voice recordings where it picked up people in the mid sentence or worse when they realized that they've been talking to themselves for a good 20 seconds. I did however stopped doing that as I got older and the phone calls started to get more serious and the social norm is to not to prank on people who are doing business with you, which definitely undermines your credibility to be the serious person in general. but perhaps I am not the serious type.","lastmodified":"2022-04-02T06:45:25.798982477Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/nanowrimo-20220401prompt2":{"title":"NaNoWriMo - 10 min prompt","content":"Prompt #2: Write a scene where one character lies to another.

The man reeked with alcohol and urine, considering the general atmosphere of the lower deck this should have been an acceptable condition for the most of the people on board. Ben was an exception. \nHe quickly came to realize why not many hawkers traveled far up north. The ship, Winking Sparrow, was full of people like the man in front of him, rough, unclean and uneducated.\n\"You heard me sonny or what, you deaf?\" the old man repeated with his spit flying everywhere. Ben swore some just hit his face.\n\"Oh apologies, I was just admiring the scene.\" Ben quickly lifted his gaze from the hook and awkwardly smiled back at him. I'd better leave this place and head up to see Marney instead, at this rate, they'll eat her for dinner. he thought. \n\"apologies accepted and what scene, you mean these? I could tell you all about it. It happened when...\" the old man started rambling on with heavy sea accent it almost sounded like another language to him and he couldn't simply get up and leave or else he feared he might get hooked by the old man's left... hand.\nBen bitterly smiled and nodded in parts where the old man was explaining about the fishing trip to the deep seas and where his ship was surrounded by a thick fog then people started loosing their marbles and started attacking each other thinking they're the monsters. He claimed he kept his head above his shoulders.","lastmodified":"2022-04-02T06:45:25.798982477Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/nanowrimo20220401prompt3":{"title":"​Prompt #3: What is your main character’s most embarrassing memory? Has it affected the things they do or the ways they interact with other characters now?","content":"Ollie and Ben are never in good terms as long as he can remember. his brother was always sick and their father was always concerned for him more than anything. Ben was healthy and he had all the love and attention from his grandfather. Ollie was going to be the heir for the merchant business of the family and to make up for his lack of health he made up with his brilliant intellect and there was no dispute about how much smarter he was compared to Ben. He was analytical and thoughtful. it was admiring how calm and collected he was all the time despite he's just 2 years older than himself. \n\nThere was a time when their father was taking his sons to the market to teach them the art of barter and appraisal of goods. Ben accompanied his father and his brother as if he was an appendix because his father's gaze was always on Ollie rather than at Ben, teaching him the basics of reading the scales and talking to fellow merchants. Ollie was spared from doing small errands as his frail body won't last if he was running around the market area so it always fell on Ben's laps. \n\nOne time he was watching deal of some precious metal trade and the man was passing around the object to inspect them. their father was reminded the two boys to pay close attention. they were weighing the ingot on the scale and the father was holding it to inspect it and requested the merchant whether his boys can have a look at the ingot themselves.\n\nthe father gave the boys his own ingot  about the same size and explained about using your own reference to do the deal. so both of them were able to hold the ingots on each hand to compare. When Ben held them, there was this weird tingling sensation on his fingertips that he couldn't express with his words. Something about the two ingots were different. It was about the same size and same weight. both had passed the scratch test to see if it was simply coated or the real deal. But something was off in Ben's hands as if something was not natural about it. Ben said they're different and the merchant's ingot felt unnatural.\n\nThe merchant laughed off and wanted to rush to close the transactions.","lastmodified":"2022-04-02T06:45:25.798982477Z","tags":null},"/notes/Legends":{"title":"Legends","content":"This is soon to be my growing list of [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) data for who knows why I am setting this up for other than I could potentially use it for sorting things out.
